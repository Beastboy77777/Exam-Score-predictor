# Exam Score Predictor ðŸ“Š

This project uses Machine Learning Regression to predict exam scores based on study hours, distraction levels, attendance, and other lifestyle factors.

## ðŸš€ How to Use
- Open exam_score_predictor.ipynb to view the full analysis and model.
- The dataset used for training is included as exam_data.csv.

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview
- Algorithm Used: Linear Regression
- Key Findings: Study hours strongly correlate with exam performance (RÂ² = 0.85)
- Final Accuracy Metrics:
  - MAE: 4.83
  - MSE: 34.88
  - RÂ² Score: 0.858
